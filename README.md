Roomi is a mobile-friendly web application designed to help flatmates efficiently manage shared household tasks. The app allows users to register, log in, assign chores, track task progress, leave comments, upload completion photos, and rate each otherâ€™s contributions. It aims to promote fairness, transparency, and communication in shared living spaces.

The application is deployed on an Amazon EC2 server and is fully database-driven using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. The backend handles user authentication, task management, file uploads, and comment systems through RESTful API endpoints. All data is securely stored and validated.

You can access the live version of the application here:
